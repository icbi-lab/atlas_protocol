# # Quality control and filtering
#
# For a meaningful downstream analysis, it is necessary to distinguish empty and low quality
# droplets (or wells) from *bona fide* cells. This can be achieved by investigating the number of detected
# UMIs and genes per cell, as well as the fraction of mitochondrial reads. A low number of genes
# and counts per cell can indicate empty droplets or microwells, respectively. A high fraction of
# mitochondrial reads, on the other hand, may indicate ruptured cells that lost most of their cytoplasmic RNA
# having retained only their mitochondria {cite}`lueckenCurrentBestPractices2019,lunStepbystepWorkflowLowlevel2016`.
# The metrics need to be considered jointly, as a high mitochondrial content *per se* could also be indicative of respiratory processes
# being upregulated in the cell, conveying a meaningful biological signal.
#
# Appropriate cutoffs are commonly determined by plotting the distributions of the quality metrics across all cells in a
# sample or dataset, and visually determining breakpoints between “signal” and “noise” distributions
#  {cite}`lueckenCurrentBestPractices2019`. This is the strategy we applied for building the lung cancer atlas in {cite}`salcherHighresolutionSinglecellAtlas2022a`.
# However, since these thresholds need to be determined for each dataset -- or, ideally, sample -- independently, this process requires a lot of manual interventions.
# Therefore, here we demonstrate automated removal of outliers based on median absolute deviation as suggested in {cite:t}`germainPipeCompGeneralFramework2020` and {cite:t}`heumosBestPracticesSinglecell2023`.

# **datasets vs. studies**
#
# By “study”, we refer to a scientific publication, while with “dataset”,
# we refer to a set of samples that was generated using the same sequencing platform and processed in the same way.
# One study may contain one or multiple datasets. Datasets must be processed independently.

# **Ambient RNA removal**
#
# Both droplet and microwell based sequencing are subject to ambient RNA contamination. These are
# RNA molecules that are uniformly present in the cell suspension and may, for instance, originate
# from dead cells. As a consequence, ambient RNA molecules are profiled together with the
# cell-specific RNA in each droplet or well. This introduces a bias in the data that may hamper
# downstream analysis. For instance, if droplets are contaminated with RNA of cell-lineage markers,
# their expression may show up in cell-types that are known not to express these genes. Ambient
# RNA can be removed computationally by tools such as SoupX {cite}`youngSoupXRemovesAmbient2020`,
# DecontX {cite}`yangDecontaminationAmbientRNA2020`, CellBender {cite}`flemingUnsupervisedRemovalSystematic2022`,
# and SCAR {cite}`shengProbabilisticMachineLearning2022` that statistically model the measured UMI counts in each cell as the mixture
# of cell-specific and cell-free RNA.
#
# Ambient RNA removal methods typically require unfiltered UMI counts as input, which is not routinely
# available for publicly avilable dataset. For this reason, we did not perform ambient RNA removal {cite}`salcherHighresolutionSinglecellAtlas2022a`,
# and are not showing it as part of this tutorial.

#
# 1. Label genes by common QC categories, such as mitochondrial genes, ribosomal genes and hemoglobin genes

# %%
# mitochondrial genes
adata.var["mt"] = adata.var_names.str.startswith("MT-")
# ribosomal genes
adata.var["ribo"] = adata.var_names.str.startswith(("RPS", "RPL"))
# hemoglobin genes.
adata.var["hb"] = adata.var_names.str.contains("^HB[^(P)]")

# 2. Add per-cell QC metrics to `adata.obs`

# %%

# %% [markdown]
# ## 4. pre-filtering
#
# In this step, we apply a very conservative filter to the number of detected genes and the number of reads per cell. This step will remove cells and genes that are almost certainly non-informative, but still leaves many low-quality cells that need to be dealt with later.
#
# 1. remove cells that don't have a minimum number of counts and detected genes.

# %%
sc.pp.filter_cells(adata, min_counts=500)
sc.pp.filter_cells(adata, min_genes=200)

# %% [markdown]
# 2. remove genes that are not present in at least 20 cells.

# %%
sc.pp.filter_genes(adata, min_cells=20)

# %% [markdown]
# ## 5. outlier detection
#
# Similar to what is described in {cite}`germainPipeCompGeneralFramework2020` and {cite}`heumosBestPracticesSinglecell2023`,
# we apply a relativly lenient filter that removes cells that are outliers in at least two of the following categories
#  * log1p total counts by > 5 MAD
#  * log1p detected genes by > 5 MAD
#  * fraction of counts in top 20% of genes by > 5 MAD
#  * fraction of mitochondrial counts > 3 MAD
#
# :::{important}
# Using too stringent cutoffs may remove entire cell-types!
# It is better to apply permissive filtering here, and remove remaining low-quality cells during cell-type annotation.
# :::
#
# 1. Define outliers in each category
