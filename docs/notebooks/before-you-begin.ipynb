    "\n",
    "For working with up to 1 million cells the absolute minimum will be a workstation with 250GB of RAM and 16 CPU cores.\n",
    "Additionally, we recommend a GPU, as scvi-tools is faster by at least one order of magnitude compared to CPU-only computing. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Software prerequisites\n",
    "For the following instructions, we assume you are working on Linux and have set-up the [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) package manager and a way of working with [jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). \n",
    "In case you don't, we recommend setting up [miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#download) and following the jupyter lab [installation instructions](https://jupyter.org/install).\n",

    "conda activate atlas_protocol\n",

    "In order to make conda environments work with jupyter notebooks, we suggest installing [nb_conda_kernels](https://github.com/Anaconda-Platform/nb_conda_kernels). \n",

    "Publicly available single-cell datasets come in all forms and flavors. For building the atlas, we need for each dataset (1) a gene expression count matrix and (2) cell-level metadata. Gene expression data is often available from standardized repositories such as gene expression omnibus (GEO), while metadata may be available as supplementary information of the original publication. For some datasets, only read-level data can be downloaded as FASTQ files and you will need to preprocess the data from scratch. Ideally, all datasets could be re-processed from FASTQ files with a consistent reference genome and genome annotations. However, in our experience, some datasets are only available in a processed form, requiring some sort of gene identifier remapping later on. \n",
