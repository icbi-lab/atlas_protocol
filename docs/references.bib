               widely used and comprehensive databases of gene sets for
               performing gene set enrichment analysis. Since its creation,
               MSigDB has grown beyond its roots in metabolic disease and
               cancer to include >10,000 gene sets. These better represent a
               wider range of biological processes and diseases, but the
               utility of the database is reduced by increased redundancy
               across, and heterogeneity within, gene sets. To address this
               challenge, here we use a combination of automated approaches and
               expert curation to develop a collection of ``hallmark'' gene
               sets as part of MSigDB. Each hallmark in this collection
               consists of a ``refined'' gene set, derived from multiple
               ``founder'' sets, that conveys a specific biological state or
               process and displays coherent expression. The hallmarks
               effectively summarize most of the relevant information of the
               original founder sets and, by reducing both variation and
               redundancy, provide more refined and concise inputs for gene set
               enrichment analysis.",

               a widely used approach to characterize the functional status of
               transcriptional regulatory circuits. Several strategies and data
               sets have been proposed to link the target genes likely
               regulated by a TF, each one providing a different level of
               evidence. The most established ones are (1) manually curated
               repositories, (2) interactions derived from ChIP-seq binding
               data, (3) in silico prediction of TF binding on gene promoters,
               and (4) reverse-engineered regulons from large gene expression
               data sets. However, it is not known how these different sources
               of regulons affect the TF activity estimations and, thereby,
               downstream analysis and interpretation. Here we compared the
               accuracy and biases of these strategies to define human TF
               regulons by means of their ability to predict changes in TF
               activities in three reference benchmark data sets. We assembled
               a collection of TF-target interactions for 1541 human TFs and
               evaluated how different molecular and regulatory properties of
               the TFs, such as the DNA-binding domain, specificities, or mode
               of interaction with the chromatin, affect the predictions of TF
               activity. We assessed their coverage and found little overlap on
               the regulons derived from each strategy and better performance
               by literature-curated information followed by ChIP-seq data. We
               provide an integrated resource of all TF-target interactions

               power and better interpretability. Here, we present decoupleR, a
               Bioconductor and Python package containing computational methods
               to extract these activities within a unified framework.
               decoupleR allows us to flexibly run any method with a given
               resource, including methods that leverage mode of regulation and
               weights of interactions, which are not present in other
               frameworks. Moreover, it leverages OmniPath, a meta-resource
               comprising over 100 databases of prior knowledge. Using
               decoupleR, we evaluated the performance of methods on
               transcriptomic and phospho-proteomic perturbation experiments.
               Our findings suggest that simple linear models and the consensus
               score across top methods perform better than other methods at
               predicting perturbed regulators. Availability and
